# Kennard-Stone-Mahalanobis
Data splitting using Mahalanobis distance can enhance our results significantly when training a neural network in comparison to euclidean distance. Tensorflow doesn't offer Mahalanobis distance for data splitting, thus the need for this simple code that's still under work
